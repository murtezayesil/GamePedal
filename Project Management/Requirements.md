# Components for a basic game engine
    
1. Game environment
    - Visual
    - Audial
    - Text (high priority)

2. Interacting with environment
    - Multiple Choice based (Menu driven) (Text)
    - Triggering events (chain reaction of entity conditions/states)
    eg. shooting, standing on, passing by, causing noise etc.
    - Changing states of objects

3. Reading player input to affect the environment
    - Wait for player input (eg. turn based) (high priority)
    - Keyboard interrupt handling (walking as long as 'w' key is pressed)
    - mouse interrupt handling (LMB click select/gun firing while LMB hold and drag means select-all in area/continuous firing)
    
4. Entities
    - Fixed immovable (map, building, road)
    - Items (virtual, in inventory / physical, in game world)
    - Creatures (player, enemy, citizen etc)
    
5.
